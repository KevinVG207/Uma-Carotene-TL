        "All eyes are on No. 8, Oguri Cap! \\nToday is her last race in the Twinkle Series!",
        "She's called \"The Monster\", but her last few runs \\ncould be considered unbefitting of that title.",
        "In her last big race, the strong Oguri, the overwhelming Oguri! \\nWill she be able to show it to us one last time!?",

        "Haaaaaaaaa!!!!",
        "Oguri's taken the lead! But the ones behind are closing in!",
        "Just 200 m to the finish!",
        "On her final run, can Oguri Cap show us a miracle!?"
