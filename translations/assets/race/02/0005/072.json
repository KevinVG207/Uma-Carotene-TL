        "With the gates opened, all the Uma\\nMusume are off to a clean start",
        "Looking to the outside, number 12, Silence Suzuka is pulling\\nforward, increasing her speed to pass the inside runners.",
        "The other Uma Musume don't try to recklessly chase her, \\nand Silence Suzuka takes the lead",
        "Today she's also chosen to escape, \\nwe'll see what kind of result this leads to",
        "Hoooo~! Suzuka's really goin' hard!",
        "Not to win, but for her dreams- Just by carrying those feelings,\\nshe looks like she's really enjoying it.",
        "Uwaa…! Suzuka-san!",
        "Silence Suzuka doesn't slow down as she continues\\nforward on the opposite end of the track",
        "The sound of my own horseshoes…",
        "The feel of the wind in the lead…",
        "It's true, running feels…",
        "Great…!",
        "What's this? The leader, Silence Suzuka, increases her pace\\nagain, pulling further away from the pack!",
        "Silence Suzuka is already approaching the 3rd corner! There's\\nalready more than a 10 length difference between her and second!",
        "What an amazingly high pace! \\nIs this her normal pace, or is she going too fast?!",
        "Silence Suzuka is still in the lead heading in to the straight!",
        "But the rest are slowly closing the gap! \\nIs this it for Silence Suzuka?!",
        "…This scenery…",
        "I won't yield it!!",
        "Haaaaaaaa~~!!!!",
        "What's this?! Silence Suzuka is already running at that pace, \\nbut spurts here!!",
        "The others are desperately chasing her,\\nbut the lead isn't shrinking!",
        "It's Silence Suzuka!",
        "Silence Suzuka is out in front!",
        "Are you serious?! \\nShe's running as an escape but is still entering a spurt?!",
        "To think she'd run at high speed from beginning to end… \\nIt doesn't feel like there's any way she'd lose!",
        "Suzuka-saaaaan!! Goooooooooooo!!",
        "Silence Suzuka passes the 200m mark! \\nLeaning on her speed, it seems she'll push through-!",
        "With ease! The leader, \nSilence Suzuka, crosses the goal!!",
        "Silence Suzuka, splendidly held the lead! \\nWhat a shocking way to end the race!"
